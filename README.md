My name is Daniel Leong Wai Loong, and this is the modified version of the Brick Destroyer game. The motivation for this modified version of the game is to learn the ways of refactoring, addition of code to make the game more presentable, learn how to use github, and generate Javadoc comments for classes and methods.

Firstly, weâ€™re presented with a working code but with a whole lot of unnecessary coding and a game that works but can be better. Hence, I started generating meaningful comments for Javadocs. After Javadocs, I started to do some refactoring. One of the major refactoring I did was to separate the Crack class in Brick Class into its individual class. Because, it makes more sense for the classes to be separated as both of them achieve different goals in the game. By separating the classes the game code seems neater as the code of the classes are shorter and it is easier to connect Crack class to the Brick class now.

Next, I modified the game by adding a new info button where it will show the player the controls of the game, as well as the rules for the game. This way, the player should have a better understanding of the game when they read the information before playing. Furthermore, I added a new level where it has a stronger brick that requires the player to break.

Separating the Crack Class from the Brick Class was troublesome for me as I forgot the basics of Java methods. I struggled to get the parameters right and thus cost me a lot of time whilst doing this project. The silver lining in this was that I got back some of the basics of Java and made the rest of the modification easier.

Lastly, I am personally very proud of the new level I created where I reuse some of the code that was already in the game and changed it to be a slightly harder level for the players.
